## Key Insights

1. **First-mover advantage in Norway** — No competition. You define the market.

2. **BTCHEL is your main competitor** — They claim "Nordic," you could claim "Scandinavia" or "Arctic."

3. **Summer timing is good** — Between the major European conferences.

4. **Price should reflect:**
   - First-year conference (lower barrier to entry)
   - Higher travel costs to Bodø (offset with competitive pricing)
   - Unique Arctic experience (justifies some premium)

5. **Consider local pricing:**
   - Discounted "Nordic resident" tier?
   - Student pricing?
   - Norwegian kroner option?

---

## Action Items

1. **Finalize ticket tiers** — I recommend Option A for Year 1
2. **Set up ticketing** — Eventbrite or Bitcoin-native (BTCPay?)
3. **Announce early bird pricing ASAP** — Generate buzz
4. **Emphasize uniqueness:**
   - "The world's northernmost Bitcoin conference"
   - "Bitcoin above the Arctic Circle"
   - "Where the midnight sun meets sound money"
