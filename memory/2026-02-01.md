## Personal Notes
Glenn went to bed around midnight. Asked me to:
1. Research Bitcoin conferences 2026 & pricing comparison tonight
2. Add "Done" section to Kanban with today's accomplishments
3. Set reminder for Gmail workspace setup tomorrow

First real day working together. He named me after his grandmother — that means something.
